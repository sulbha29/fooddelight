        <p>"Food Delights” is considered as an increasingly used application in restaurant management. Just a few years ago, people used to spend long time waiting for a table to be ready for them at a restaurant. And after that, they would wait longer time to order their food. There was no surprise that the food took too long to be prepared. In short, the whole enjoyment of eating did eventually result in boredom and tiredness for customers. From another side, this is the restaurant management and staff who used to stand much pressure to handle a lot of customers at the same time. With great technology in general and the internet in specific, customers can be happy by using online food ordering and reservation. This facilitates the work of restaurant managers and staff. The system will make the entire process for the restaurant manager much easier and faster compared with traditional methods. On the other hand, these days’ customers can place their orders and make their reservations as quickly and enjoyably as a click on their computers or smart devices. All in all, both customer and menu information management as well as report are the very wonderful aspects of the modern world in restaurant industry.</p>
